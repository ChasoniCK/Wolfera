# Wolfera

Wolfera is a small, expression‑oriented programming language and interpreter implemented in Python. The syntax is lightweight, focused on readability and easy experimentation.

This project is **based on** the language and interpreter from [myopl-plus-plus](https://github.com/angelcaru/myopl-plus-plus), with a streamlined structure, updated syntax choices, and a fully modular codebase.

## Highlights

- **Readable, minimal syntax**
- **Expression‑oriented design**
- **Small, easy to read and modify interpreter**

## Quick Description

Wolfera provides core language features like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, and basic I/O, with a simple lexer‑parser‑interpreter pipeline.

## Advantages

- **Great for experimentation**: the interpreter and AST are clear and approachable.
- **Modular architecture**: lexer, parser, AST, interpreter, and errors are separated for maintainability.
